OIBSIP Internship Projects

This repository includes the projects completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP), showcasing skills in data analysis, machine learning, and classification.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview
Email Spam Detection:

Objective: To build a model that classifies emails as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, NLTK
Dataset: Processed email data with labels for spam and non-spam messages.
Outcome: Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam emails through feature extraction and machine learning classification.
Unemployment Analysis:

Objective: Analyzing unemployment data to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that impact joblessness.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: Unemployment statistics, categorized by region, demographics, and time.
Outcome: Provided insights on unemployment trends, visualized patterns, and identified factors influencing unemployment rates.

Iris Flower Classification:

Objective: To classify iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements using machine learning techniques.
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn
Dataset: Classic Iris dataset containing three classes of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Outcome: Built a robust classification model with high accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-class classification.
